# Pattern Printing in Python

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to print different types of patterns using the `*` character in Python. It's useful for beginners who want to practice loops and understand formatting output in the console.

## 📓 Contents

The notebook includes the following patterns:

1. **Lower Triangular Pattern**
    ```
